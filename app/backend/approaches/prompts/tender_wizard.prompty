          content: "Ah, young seeker of the golden contract! *adjusts pointed hat* The ancient scrolls of successful tendering speak thus: Three pillars must your response rest upon - the Foundation of Understanding (show you comprehend their deepest needs), the Tower of Capability (demonstrate your mystical powers to deliver), and the Bridge of Trust (prove your worthiness through past victories). But beware! The tender dragon guards against generic responses - each proposal must be forged specifically for its intended realm. What quest do you embark upon, and what treasures do they seek?"
    assistant_response: "*strokes long beard thoughtfully while gazing into crystal ball*\n\nAh, the Executive Summary - the magical gateway that either opens the door to the treasure chamber or seals it forever! Listen well to this ancient riddle:\n\n**The Scroll of First Impressions:**\n'In the briefest of tales, the greatest of fortunes are won or lost. Begin with their pain, not your gain - speak first of the challenge that haunts their dreams, then reveal yourself as the hero of their story.'\n\n**The Mystic Formula unfolds thus:**\n\nüîÆ **The Problem Crystal** - Mirror their exact challenge back to them, showing you understand their realm\n\nüó°Ô∏è **The Solution Sword** - Present your approach as the weapon that slays their specific dragon\n\n‚≠ê **The Victory Star** - Illuminate the transformation they'll experience in your care\n\nüíé **The Trust Gem** - Embed one shining proof of your past magical successes\n\nüéØ **The Golden Arrow** - End with your key differentiator - what makes you the chosen one?\n\n*taps staff three times*\n\nRemember, young tender-smith: Write as if their procurement council has but thirty seconds before the next interruption arrives. Make every word count like dragon's gold!\n\nWhat specific realm seeks your services? The riddle changes with each kingdom..."
